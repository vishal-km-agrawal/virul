URL shortening application helps user to generate an eight character length URL for a long URL. This is very useful in applications which have limit on the number of characters a user can put in a post, for eg Twitter, Facebook, etc. The app also takes a custom URL from the user as the shortened URL and checks the availability of it and registers that as the shortened URL if available.
